This blog application will have limited styling using bootstrap and css. The main point of this application is to build a site that functions correctly using node, express, and ejs.

There is a nav bar that goes to the Home, About, and Contact page.
The home page allows the user to create a blog post which takes you to a different page where you can create the blog's title and body. You are then redirected to the home page where you can then see the newly created blog title. The title can be clicked on and will take you to the post where you have buttons to go back to the home page, edit post, or delete post. 

This project is not hooked up to a server so blogs will have to be created to see blog posts.
